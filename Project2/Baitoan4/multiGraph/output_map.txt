Number of vertices: 5
Number of edges: 7

Outgoing connections:
Vertex 0 -> 1 [edge(0,1)], 1 [edge(0,1)], 2 [edge(0,2)]
Vertex 1 -> 2 [edge(1,2)], 3 [edge(1,3)]
Vertex 2 -> 4 [edge(2,4)]
Vertex 3 -> 4 [edge(3,4)]
Vertex 4 -> (no outgoing connections)

Incoming connections:
Vertex 0 <- (no incoming connections)
Vertex 1 <- 0 [edge(0,1)], 0 [edge(0,1)]
Vertex 2 <- 0 [edge(0,2)], 1 [edge(1,2)]
